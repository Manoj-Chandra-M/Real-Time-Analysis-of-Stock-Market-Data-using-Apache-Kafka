Steps to follow to execute this project

Create an EC2 instance on AWS
Connect to instance using SSH client
copy paste the ssh command on git bash opened at stock market folder created locally.
Connect to EC2 instance
Type the below commands to download kafka from Apache documentation

wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.4.1/kafka_2.12-3.4.1.tgz
tar -xvf kafka_2.12-3.4.1.tgz

Kafka runs on JVM so we need to set up java
Refer this article on how to install java 8 on amazon linux. https://tecadmin.net/install-java-on-amazon-linux/
use these commands:
$ sudo amazon-linux-extras enable corretto8
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel -y

Check the java version:
java -version

Navigate into the Kafka folder downloaded
cd kafka_2.12-3.4.1

Before starting zookeeper and kafka, make sure the address is pointing to public IP and not private since we need to connect Jupyter notebook which is in local to AWS instance.
Steps:
sudo nano config/server.properties
Change ADVERTISED_LISTENERS to public ip of the EC2 instance

Start zookeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Open another window to start kafka
But first ssh to to your ec2 machine as done above

Start Kafka-server
export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms128M" 
This is done to initialize memory of kafka
cd kafka_2.12-3.4.1
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Create Topic
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console, ssh to to your ec2 machine as done above
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic demo_test_1 --bootstrap-server {Your public IP}:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

Start Producer
Follow this step on the same terminal as topic creation
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic demo_test_1 --bootstrap-server {Your public IP}:9092 

Start Consumer
In a different terminal, ssh to your EC2 machine, navigate to kafka folder then,
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic demo_test_1 --bootstrap-server {Your public IP}:9092
